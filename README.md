Hello!!  Iam very glad to tell that : 
"Finally I was able to convert the figma design given to me into the responsive websites"

Tech stack used init  is : 
HTML, CSS , BOOTSTRAP and javascript !! 
BOOTSTRAP STYLING played a major role in beautifying my website: 
styling involved : 
creating containers of : About , service , growth , projects , and feedback and styling them
every text is styled by a bootstrap class, coz i was more focused on making it more visually appealing and positioning  of the text 

*dynamic careousel is used to bring the sliding effect of images using HTML and Javascript; 

*static careosel is used to flex the acheivements of the company 

javascript functions  is used to redirect the readmore button to the fyle website 

HTML option tag associated with javascript functions helped to build the our projects section 
getform.io is being used to create the endpoint as instructed in the assignment 

 Looking forward to make more changes based on the requirement... have a Nice day.
